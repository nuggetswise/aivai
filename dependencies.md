You have all the files and folders mentioned in both plan and plan2 in your current scaffolding. However, you do not yet have any Python packages or dependencies installed—your pyproject.toml is still empty.

**What’s missing for a working MVP:**
- You need to add and install the required Python packages for your stack, as described in plan2 and the tech stack sections:
  - FastAPI
  - pydantic
  - faiss
  - trafilatura
  - readability-lxml
  - sentence-transformers or HuggingFace Transformers (for embeddings and TTS)
  - requests, httpx, or aiohttp (for web requests)
  - ffmpeg-python or pydub (for audio mixing)
  - Any LLM client libraries (e.g., openai, google-generativeai, etc.)
  - poetry (for dependency management, if not already installed globally)
  - pytest (for testing)
  - python-dotenv (for .env support)
  - Optionally: uvicorn (for running FastAPI), tqdm (for progress bars), etc.

**Next step:**  
You should update your pyproject.toml with these dependencies and run poetry install to set up your environment. If you want, I can generate a starter pyproject.toml with all the required packages for you. Let me know if you’d like to proceed!
