    "raw_content": "Ocean and Coastal Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy DRAFT OUTLINE -- For Public Comment Do Not CiteBegin Draft This draft outline is being released to gather public input on the range of ideas that the Ocean and Coastal working group could consider for a statewide climate change adaptation strategy. The working group will consider this public input as we create a revised draft strategy that will also be available for public comment in the future. Eventually, what is developed through this open and public process will become part of the Resources Agency\u2019s statewide climate adaptation strategy. For more information about the statewide plan, please see http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/adaptation/index.html. Ocean and Coastal Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy DRAFT OUTLINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT\u2013 Do not cite Vision The Ocean and Coastal Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy recommends proactive steps to create a future where ocean and coastal resources, as well as the communities along California\u2019s coast and San Francisco Bay, can evolve to changing climatic conditions. The strategy aims to achieve this vision in a way that protects the quality of the natural environment and promotes economic prosperity for the benefit of all Californians. Scope The geographic focus of this strategy extends from California\u2019s ocean environment to the onshore areas impacted by the sea, both along the open coast and in coastal bays, lagoons, estuaries and wetlands. This boundary is not fixed: in some cases, inland areas that influence the coast or are influenced by coastal processes (e.g., sediment sources from coastal watersheds) are included in the scope. Purpose of the Document This strategy is meant to provide guidance to the numerous organization and public entities that manage geographical areas and resources discussed within this document. Many difficult management decisions are needed to adapt to future climate change impacts; this document is intended to be a strategy to lay the groundwork for future discussions and planning actions by these organizations. Furthermore, this strategy will set the stage for the legal and regulatory changes that are likely to be necessary to implement adaptation approaches. - 2 -Guiding Principles 1) Protect public health and safety and critical infrastructure. 2) Promote sustainable communities, prosperous coastal and ocean-related economies, coastal recreation and tourism, and resilient development. 3) Promote resilience in ocean and coastal ecosystem management. 4) Acknowledge that significant climate-caused changes will occur. Components of the Strategy 1) A vulnerability assessment will establish the type and extent of potential climate changes such as sea level rise, storm surges, and changing ocean conditions and how these changes will impact infrastructure and development, human populations, economy, and natural habitats and species. 2) Coastal adaptation strategies (both overarching and specific) will address these impacts. As much as possible, each strategy will be accompanied by case studies that elucidate that strategy and guidance on how it should be implemented (i.e., potential changes to policies or legislation). 3) Next steps for adaptation implementation include identifying needed research/data/products; developing an iterative process for updating strategies based on new information; formulating guidance for how to implement these strategies at a local level; creating opportunities for data dissemination and decision support; determining needed legislative changes; and establishing mechanisms for improved coordination between state agencies and with federal agencies, other states, local governments, coastal tourism groups, private investors, and the insurance industry. Ocean and Coastal Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy DRAFT OUTLINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT\u2013 Do not cite VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT The vulnerability assessment will include a discussion of (1) the possible climate and sea level rise scenarios based on the state-of-the science and (2) a summary of the known impacts to California resources and people based on these scenarios. Below is the current outline that we are considering for this discussion. Scenarios Sea Level Rise, Inundation, and Coastal Storms Sea level rise and erosion risks Coastal storms and extreme weather events Changing Ocean and Coastal Conditions Salinity changes (especially in estuaries) Temperature changes (air and sea) Changes to ocean currents, upwelling, and stratification Ocean acidification Impacts Effects of Sea Level Rise, Inundation, and Coastal Storms - Impacts to the Built Environment Infrastructure at risk Impacts to coastal populations Economic impacts Effects of Changing Ocean and Coastal Conditions \u2013 Impacts to the Natural Environment Impacts to coastal ecosystems \u2013 beaches, wetlands, intertidal and subtidal habitats Changes in protected species populations (endangered species, marine mammals, etc.) commercially significant species (fisheries), marine ecosystems and food webs, and introduction of new invasive species Economic impacts - 3 -Ocean and Coastal Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy DRAFT OUTLINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT\u2013 Do not cite COASTAL ADAPTATION STRATEGIES In future drafts, several specific strategies will be included under each overarching strategy. The outline, below, provides questions to initiate discussion about what these specific strategies might include. Planning for Sea Level Rise, Inundation, and Coastal Storms Overarching Strategy #1. Provide guidelines for assessing critical existing infrastructure and development and determining when and what action is needed to reduce vulnerability. For areas where protection or retrofit is appropriate: What innovative approaches exist to protect or rebuild infrastructure and development so that it is less vulnerable to coastal hazards? For areas where alternative strategies can be used: What innovative approaches exist to incentivize or regulate moving infrastructure and development away from coastal hazards? Overarching Strategy #2. Ensure new development is properly sited and designed. What new or existing approaches can be employed to direct future development away from areas subject to coastal hazards? Can new buildings and infrastructure be built or sited in a way that is resistant to coastal hazards? Planning for Changing Ocean Conditions Overarching Strategy #3. Ensure that critical coastal and ocean habitats and recreational areas are protected and maintained. How do we plan for and execute habitat protection that accounts for future changes? Overarching Strategy #4. Formulate management approaches that adapt as certain climate-induced thresholds are reached. What management decision criteria could be changed so that new actions are taken once certain climate impacts are detected? Planning for a Changing Political Climate Overarching Strategy #5. Implement policy changes at the local, regional, and national level. What local planning documents or ordinances need to change to adapt to coastal impacts? What federal legislation might be changed to promote adaptation at the state level? - 4 -Ocean and Coastal Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy DRAFT OUTLINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT\u2013 Do not cite NEXT STEPS Identify research/data/products necessary for planning and implementing adaptation measures. Provide a framework for: \u2022 updating strategies based on new information \u2022 creating guidance about how to implement these strategies on a local scale \u2022 creating opportunities for data dissemination and decision support \u2022 determining needed legislative changes Develop mechanisms for improved coordination between state agencies and with federal agencies, other states, private investors, local agencies, and the insurance industry.End Draft - 5 -"

In 1992, some 56 percent of the population was living in poverty. By 2016, that figure had fallen to [21 percent](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?locations=UG). Yet, the global economic ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of climate change are forcing the country to confront new challenges: shocks not only threaten further progress but can reverse hard won successes of the past.\n\n[Around 72 percent of Uganda\u2019s labor force works in agriculture \u2013 a sector that is highly climate sensitive.](#) Take coffee: Uganda is Africa\u2019s second largest exporter of coffee. Over 17 percent of Uganda\u2019s exports coming from just this high-value crop. Recent droughts, however, are estimated to have destroyed half of all coffee yields. In the coming decades, changing climatic conditions are expected to pose profound [challenges to Uganda\u2019s coffee sector](https://blog.ciat.cgiar.org/climate-smart-coffee-in-uganda/): without adaptive measures, only 1 percent of Uganda\u2019s current coffee producing land is expected to be able to continue production. And coffee is just one sector that could face mounting impacts from climate change: around [2.3 million poor people](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/669141603288540994/people-in-harms-way-flood-exposure-and-poverty-in-189-countries) in Uganda also face high levels of flood risk.\n\nIn countries around the world, climate change poses a significant risk threatening the lives and livelihoods of people. These risks cannot be reduced to zero, which means governments must take decisive action to help firms and people manage them. Doing so requires planning ahead and putting in place proactive measures that not only reduce climate risk but also accelerate development, and cut poverty, according to a new report, *[The Adaptation Principles: A Guide for Designing Strategies for Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/34780)*.\n\n*\u201cAdaptation cannot be an afterthought to development. Instead, by integrating it into policy thinking up front, governments can catalyze robust economic development while also reducing vulnerability to climate change,\u201d* says **Lead Economist, St\u00e9phane Hallegatte**, who co-authored the report with Jun Rentschler and Julie Rozenberg, all of the World Bank.\n\n[The report lays out six universal \u201cPrinciples of Adaptation and Resilience\u201d and 26 concrete actions that governments can use to develop effective strategies.](#) To support the development and design of these actions, it also includes 12 toolboxes with methodologies and data sources that can ensure that strategies are evidence-based.\n\n**1. Build resilient foundations with rapid and inclusive development**\n\nPoverty and the lack of access to basic services\u2014including infrastructure, financial services, health care, and social protection\u2014are strong predictors of [vulnerability to climate change](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22787). To put it another way: the poorer communities are, the more climate change will affect them. [No adaptation strategy can be successful without ensuring high-vulnerability populations have the financial, technical, and institutional resources they need to adapt.](#)\n\n**2. Help people and firms do their part.**\n\nIt\u2019s critical to boost the adaptive capacity of households and firms: many already have incentives to adapt, but they need help overcoming obstacles, ranging from a lack of information and financing, to behavioral biases and imperfect markets. Governments can make information on climate risks available, clarify responsibilities and liabilities, [support innovation and access to the best technologies](https://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/innovation-climate-change-adaptation-does-it-reach-those-who-need-it-most), and ensure financing is available to all especially for solutions that come with high upfront costs. And they will also need to provide direct support to the poorest people, who cannot afford to invest in adaptation [but are the most vulnerable to experiencing devastating effects of climate change](https://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/covid-climate-change-and-poverty-avoiding-worst-impacts).\n\n**3. Revise land use plans and protect critical infrastructure.**\n\nIn addition to direct support to households and businesses, governments must also play a role in protecting public investments, assets, and services. Power and water outages and transport disruptions are estimated to cost [more than $390 billion per year](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/31805) already in developing countries. But if countries have the right data, risk models, and decision-making methods available, the incremental cost of building the resilience of new infrastructure assets is small\u2014only around 3 percent of total investments. Urban and land use plans are also important responsibilities of the public sector, and they influence massive private investments in housing and productive assets, so it is vital these adapt to evolving long-term climate risks to avoid locking people into high-risk areas.\n\n**4. Help people and firms recover faster and better.**\n\nRisks and impacts cannot be reduced to zero. Governments must develop strategies to ensure that when disasters do occur, [people and firms can cope](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25335) without devastating long-term consequences, and can recover quickly. Preparation such as [better hydromet data](https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/34225), early warning and emergency management systems reduces physical damage and economic losses\u2014for example, shuttering windows ahead of a hurricane can reduce damage by up to 50 percent. The benefits of providing universal access to early warning systems globally have been repeatedly found to largely exceed costs, [by factors of at least 4 to 10](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/9359). And then, financial inclusion, such as access to emergency borrowing, and social protection are essential ways to help firms and people get back on their feet. [Adaptive social protection systems](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital/publication/adaptive-social-protection-building-resilience-to-shocks-key-findings), which can be rapidly scaled up to cover more people and provide bigger support after a disaster, are particularly efficient, but they rely on delivery and finance mechanisms that have to be created before a crisis occurs.\n\n**5. Manage impacts at the macro level.**\n\n[Coping with climate change impacts in one economic sector is already complicated. Coping with climate change impacts in all sectors at once requires strategic planning at the highest levels.](#) Through many impacts in many sectors ---\u00a0 from floods affecting housing prices to changes in ecosystems affecting agriculture productivity --- climate change will affect the macroeconomic situation and tax revenues. Some impacts on major sectors (especially exporting ones) can affect a country\u2019s trade balance and capital flows. And [spending needs for adaptation and resilience](https://gca.org/global-commission-on-adaptation/report) need to be added on top of existing contingent liabilities and current debt levels to create further pressure on public finances. The combination of these factors may result in new risks for macroeconomic stability, public finances and debt sustainability, and the broader financial sector. Governments will need [to manage these risks](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/21725). Because of the massive uncertainty that surrounds macroeconomic estimates of future climate change impacts, strategies to build the resilience of the economy, especially through appropriate diversification of the economic structure, export composition and tax base, are particularly attractive over the short term.\n\n**6. Prioritize according to needs, implement across sectors and monitor progress.**\n\nGovernments must not only prioritize actions to make them compatible with available resources and capacity; they must also establish [a robust institutional and legal framework](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/519821547481031999/The-World-Bank-Groups-Action-Plan-on-Climate-Change-Adaptation-and-Resilience-Managing-Risks-for-a-More-Resilient-Future.pdf), and a consistent system for monitoring progress. The main objective of an adaptation and resilience strategy is not to implement stand-alone projects: it is to ensure that all government departments and public agencies adopt and mainstream the strategy in all their decisions, and that governments continuously monitor and evaluate the impact of their decisions and actions, so they can address any challenges and adjust their actions accordingly.\n\nThe report provides a range of practical tools that can help governments implement adaptation strategies. For instance, economic analysis methodologies can help to select the most important interventions, and budget tagging methods can ensure spending is consistent with expectations. A set of 111 indicators is also provided to enable governments to track progress toward greater resilience, to identify areas that are lagging behind, and to prioritize effective measures. It also sheds light on how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic crisis can affect the design of an adaptation and resilience strategy, recognizing how it has changed the development landscape in all countries.\n\n[The impacts of climate change are already here and fast increasing and there is no silver bullet to prevent them.](#) Proactive and robust actions ahead of time, however, can go a long way to helping people and communities so that when a natural disaster strikes, not only are they better prepared to respond, but hard-won development gains are not lost.\n\n*Join us on Tuesday, December 1 2020, for a [discussion on the main findings of this report](https://www.wri.org/events/2020/12/adaptation-principles-new-approaches-building-resilience).*\n\n*\u201cThe Adaptation Principles: A Guide for Designing Strategies for Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience\u201d was produced with financial support from the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery](https://www.gfdrr.org/en).*\n\n## Related\n\n## Blogs\n\n![loader image](/content/dam/wbr-redesign/logos/ajax.gif)\n\n## WHAT'S NEW\n\n![loader image](/content/dam/wbr-redesign/logos/ajax.gif)\n![World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/media_1540be393bca9ed1fbc89eaa862044ccb08019dd2.svg?width=750&format=svg&optimize=medium)\n\n**STAY CURRENT** WITH OUR LATEST DATA & INSIGHTS\n\n\u00a9 2025 World Bank Group.

    "content": "The broad adaptation options of retreat, co-exist and defend are possible for all identified threats associated with climate change with efficacy varying with specific threats and circumstances [33,34]. Within these, the literature identifies specific adaptive actions that reflect defensive or co-existing strategies that fall short of the ultimate strategy of retreat. The actions tend to be presented as discrete or punctuated choices without consideration of comparative efficacy, synergies, or [...] The focus on \u2018defend, co-exist, or retreat\u2019 is closely aligned with the define-analyze-implement-reassess (DAIR) framework developed as a general community and rural planning template for hazards affected by climate change . Our study evaluated three possible strategies for decision-making related to coastal development and management of existing coastal resources: (1) relocate assets and people to safe areas (retreat); (2) defend existing and new structures against climate change affected [...] adaptation strategies will have less upheaval of communities and individuals. Therefore, the responsibility of implementing adaption options in a timely manner at the regional level is shared between governments, residents and businesses.

Therefore, many local communities are preparing adaptation plans. Even so, much of what was done has not been published in the peer-reviewed literature. This means that consideration of adaptation options for local communities is limited. With the objective of assisting in the development of adaptation plans, we present 80 adaptation options suitable for coastal communities that can be applied by local governments. They are a catena of options from defend to co-exist and finally, retreat that progresses as impacts become less manageable. Options are organized according to their capacity to protect local properties and infrastructure, natural systems, food production, availability of fresh and drinking water and well-being of the local population, as these are likely to be affected by climate change. To respond to multiple threats, \u2018soft\u2019 options, such as awareness raising, planning, political articulation and financial incentives, insurance and professional skills enhancement, can be encouraged immediately at relatively low cost and are reversible. For specific threats, options emphasize change in management practices as pre-emptive measures. Key audiences for this work are communities and local governments starting to consider priority actions to respond to climate change impacts.\n\nKeywords: \n\n[climate change](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=climate+change); [adaptation](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=adaptation); [coastal community](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=coastal+community); [local government](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=local+government); [responses](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=responses)\n\n1. Introduction\n---------------\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that by 2100 anthropogenically-induced climate change is likely to lead to a rise in global temperatures of 1.5 \u00b0C to 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B1-climate-08-00007)]. This will significantly affect environmental feedback systems leading to, among others, more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B1-climate-08-00007)]. In this context, in 2019, the World Economic Forum ranked extreme weather events and failure to adapt to the likely impacts of climate change as the two most significant threats to humanity [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B2-climate-08-00007)].\n\nAt the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, 195 countries agreed to increase efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change [[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B3-climate-08-00007)]. Mitigation of climate change refers to controlling the emission of greenhouse gases to retard the global warming process [[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B4-climate-08-00007)]. This is based on the understanding that temperature rise is directly related to the amount and type of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. Mitigation, therefore, refers to avoiding anthropogenically-induced climate change [[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B4-climate-08-00007)]. Despite the Paris agreement, the emission of greenhouse gases continues to increase [[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B5-climate-08-00007)] and, considering the political discourses of key countries, such as the US and Brazil, it is likely this pattern will continue in the years to come. As anthropogenically-induced climate change appears to be unavoidable [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B1-climate-08-00007)], adaptation (the process of adjustment by which risks are managed to improve community safety and well-being [[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B4-climate-08-00007)]) becomes essential.\n\nRisk stems from a combination of one or more threats and the capacity to respond to them [[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B6-climate-08-00007)]. A threat is something \u2018likely to cause damage or danger\u2019 [[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B7-climate-08-00007)]. For climate change, threats depend on how environmental feedback systems are affected. IPCC (2018) forecasts that by 2100, if global temperature rises (only) between 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, environmental feedback systems will lead to: extreme temperatures in many densely populated areas; more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events, including droughts and floods; sea-level rise between 0.26\u20130.93 m; increased ocean acidity and de-oxygenated oceanic waters; and significant biodiversity loss [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B1-climate-08-00007)]. The consequences of these global scale changes will be profound. The availability of potable water is likely to be affected by extended drought periods and the intrusion of seawater into inland waterways (caused by sea level rise and storm surge in coastal areas) [[8](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B8-climate-08-00007)]. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems will be affected by drought, flood, intrusion of seawater and change in temperatures [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B1-climate-08-00007),[8](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B8-climate-08-00007)]. Marine ecosystems will suffer through increased ocean acidity and water temperature and decreased oxygen levels, which are predicted to cause the loss of 70 per cent to 99 per cent of coral reefs [[8](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B8-climate-08-00007)]. A significant decline in biodiversity is predicted and likely to include local loss of pollinators, which with other threats, will put at risk food production [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B1-climate-08-00007)]. Community well-being is expected to be affected by higher temperatures, more frequent and extreme weather events, and sea-level rise and storm surge will more frequently cause flooding in coastal and low-lying areas resulting in damage to infrastructure and properties [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B1-climate-08-00007)]. How society responds to the forecasted risks is, therefore, paramount to the success of short and long-term sustainable development, community resilience [[9](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B9-climate-08-00007)] and resultant community well-being.\n\nDespite the sensibility of responding to the threats of climate change through strategic and planned adaptive actions, much of what has been done lacks critical assessment in the peer-reviewed literature [[10](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B10-climate-08-00007)]. This means that appraisal of adaptation options for local communities is limited, and communities may take actions that are not best practice, and may be expensive, lack efficacy and be maladaptive [[11](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B11-climate-08-00007)]. Identification of adaptation options for local communities, councils and/or local industries is the first step in strategically responding to the threats of climate change to reduce risk to issues of concern, and the motivation for this study. Focus is on coastal communities, because they are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts [[11](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B11-climate-08-00007)]. In addition, about 10 per cent of the World\u2019s population \u201clive on coastal areas that are less than 10 m above sea level\u201d [[12](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B12-climate-08-00007)]. Eighty adaptation options were identified as suitable for coastal communities and can be applied by local governments. With the objective of assisting with the development of adaptation plans, these options are described and discussed in the context of the broad adaptation options of retreat, co-exist and defend.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n------------------------\n\nAdaptation options were first identified via a systematic literature review. Systematic reviews identify articles using clearly defined search criteria, and systematic, explicit and reproducible methods to select and critically examine relevant literature [[13](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B13-climate-08-00007),[14](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B14-climate-08-00007)]. This approach is common in the health sciences and has been applied increasingly to environmental and climate change studies [[15](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B15-climate-08-00007),[16](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B16-climate-08-00007)].\n\nThe peer-reviewed literature was systematically searched using Scopus\u00a9. Keywords used in the search were: climate change, adaptation, coastal, sea level rise, local government and storm surge (\u201cTITLE-ABS-KEY (\u201cclimate change\u201d AND adaptation AND coastal AND \u201csea level rise\u201d OR \u201cstorm surge\u201d) AND DOCTYPE (ar) AND PUBYEAR > 2009\u201d). Articles not in English, published prior to 2010, and book reviews were excluded. The Scopus search retrieved 114 results. These were analyzed and works that did not directly mention adaptation options were excluded. Based on this criterion, 44 works were selected for further analysis and reviewed in full.\n\nAdaptation options identified were categorized in tables according to focus and response to threats (multiple threats, property and infrastructure, coastal flooding, inland flooding, fire, natural systems, farming, fresh and drinking water and well-being of communities). It was then noted that some category components (e.g., housing) lacked implicit adaptation options. In these cases, additional information was sourced from technical reports.\n\nBecause local demographic characteristics and cultural systems play important roles in defining adaptation options, a complete list of responses specific to a locale is unlikely to be identifiable from the literature. Hence, what we present here are widely applicable adaptation options found in the peer-reviewed literature plus those found in other sources that are likely to guide adaptation.\n\n3. Results\n----------\n\n#### 3.1. Broad Adaptation Options: Retreat, Co-Exist and Defend\n\nClimate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and hazard assessment are strongly linked [[17](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B17-climate-08-00007)], and it is evident that this intersection is a strategic planning challenge for coastal communities [[18](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B18-climate-08-00007)]. Herein, we focus on the role of climate change on flood hazards, sea level rise, storm surges/cyclones and coastal erosion, as well as the interactions of these climate change affected hazards. It is in this nexus of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction where some of the major challenges exist for local governments and planners (e.g., [[18](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B18-climate-08-00007)]).\n\nThe focus on \u2018defend, co-exist, or retreat\u2019 is closely aligned with the define-analyze-implement-reassess (DAIR) framework developed as a general community and rural planning template for hazards affected by climate change [[18](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B18-climate-08-00007)]. Our study evaluated three possible strategies for decision-making related to coastal development and management of existing coastal resources: (1) relocate assets and people to safe areas (retreat); (2) defend existing and new structures against climate change affected hazards using largely structural measures; and (3) co-exist or adapt to changing conditions by a combination of innovative planning measures [[18](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B18-climate-08-00007),[19](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B19-climate-08-00007)].\n\n#### 3.1.1. Retreat\n\nRetreat, as the name suggests, refers to moving communities, structures and/or assets from areas that are likely to be significantly affected by the impacts of global warming to areas less vulnerable to climate change impacts [[20](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B20-climate-08-00007)]. This can be the case, for example, of inhabited areas expected to experience increased frequency and extent of flooding and storm surge. While it is a radical approach, it seems that more than one million people have already been forced to retreat in response to natural hazards [[21](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B21-climate-08-00007),[22](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B22-climate-08-00007)]. While retreat is taking place in at least 27 different places, it is not an easy option [[23](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B23-climate-08-00007)]. In addition to the obvious cost of the land, which in many cases is bought by the government, and of reallocation, it has psychological and socio-cultural implications that, in many cases, cannot be mitigated [[21](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B21-climate-08-00007),[22](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B22-climate-08-00007)].\n\nExamples of retreat include Native Americans on the Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana off the Gulf of Mexico, who collectively decided to retreat in 2016; inhabitants of Grantham in Queensland, Australia; and in Oakwood Beach (New Jersey) on the fringe of New York City [[12](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B12-climate-08-00007)].\n\nThe community of Belongil Beach, in Byron Bay (Australia) adopted a managed retreat approach. The decision was based on the understanding that \u201cinfrastructure, private property and residential development are located within the coastal erosion \u2018immediate hazard zone\u2019, which is the area of shoreline predicted to erode as the result of a 100-year average recurrence interval (ARI) design storm\u201d. The erosion areas were identified and classified in accordance to the expected time for erosion. Based on this, different zonings were established: \u201cImmediate coastal hazard precinct: buildings are to be entirely modular and relocatable (by 4WD vehicle); trigger distance for relocation of development is 20 m from the coastal erosion escarpment; no building is to be within 20 m of the erosion escarpment. 50-year precinct: all residential housing is to be relocatable (by 4WD vehicle); trigger distance for relocation and/or demolition of development is 50 m from the erosion escarpment. 100-year precinct: trigger distance for relocation and/or demolition of development is 50 m from the erosion escarpment\u201d [[23](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B23-climate-08-00007)].\n\n#### 3.1.2. Defend\n\nDefend includes strategies implemented to protect assets from the impacts of flooding. It can involve the construction of seawalls and reforestation of riparian areas [[20](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B20-climate-08-00007)]. Defend is the most common response, as its disadvantages tend to be limited to financial costs, which can significantly vary depending on the circumstances. However, due to multiple reasons (e.g., storm surge maybe more intense than forecasted), defense tends to eventually fail; in which case either retreat or co-existence will be the options of choice.\n\nSaibai, which is one of the nearly 300 islands that constitute the Torres Strait Islands archipelago (Australia), is an example of a locality where the local population had to implement defensive measures [[24](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B24-climate-08-00007)]. In 2016, it had an estimated population of 465 people, 85.6% of whom were Torres Strait Islander or Aboriginal. The 108 km 2 island has an average elevation of one meter with its highest point being 1.7 m above mean sea level [[25](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B25-climate-08-00007)]. Therefore, it is prone to flooding, especially during the wet season, which coincides with the cyclone season and king tides [[26](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B26-climate-08-00007)]. The combination of increasing mean sea level rise twice that of the global rate, coastal erosion and extreme weather events leave only defensive responses other than the option to retreat. Due to the high cost associated with building a seawall around the island, the first response was to use sand bags [[27](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B27-climate-08-00007)]. As the situation worsened, the community built a handcrafted seawall that was substituted in 2017 by a Government built seawall [[28](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B28-climate-08-00007)]. Half a year after the $24.5 million Government built seawall was inaugurated, it was breached by a high tide [[29](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B29-climate-08-00007)].\n\n#### 3.1.3. Co-Exist\n\nCo-existence with climate change related threats refers to coping with the new conditions [[30](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B30-climate-08-00007)]. This option is based on the understanding that, while in specific situations nothing can be done to mitigate certain impacts, retreat and defend are either not necessary, excessively costly, or not possible. The option involves acceptance of losses, and communities must accept the risks of climate change and respond intermittently to the effects. Co-existence, besides being an expensive option in monetary terms, can be extremely traumatic due to the exposure to crisis events that may include loss of life. Despite its disadvantages, at present it appears to be the option most commonly adopted.\n\nExamples in Australia of co-existence with threats imposed by climate change include towns such as Townsville and Cairns, which are intermittently but significantly affected by cyclone and floods, and Brisbane, which is periodically affected by flooding of the Brisbane River.\n\nCyclone Yasi, for example, caused extensive damage from Cooktown to Townsville. It almost destroyed everything in its path, including 9000 km of roads and 4500 km of rail, crops, houses and businesses [[31](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B31-climate-08-00007)]. Restoration costs, from just this one cyclone, was around $7 billion [[31](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B31-climate-08-00007)].\n\nBrisbane floods are also frequent. Substantial floods, during which one-third or more of Brisbane city was inundated, occurred in 1841, 1844, 1890, 1893, 1898, 1974 and January 2011. Reconstruction of damage caused by floods costs some $100 million per year [[32](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B32-climate-08-00007)]. In addition to financial costs, the 1893 flood was associated with the loss of 35 lives, the 1974 flood with 14 deaths and more than 300 people injured; and the 2011 flood included 33 deaths (three others are still missing). The reconstruction of Brisbane from just this last flood exceeded $5 billion [[18](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B18-climate-08-00007),[32](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B32-climate-08-00007)].\n\n#### 3.2. Punctuated Adaptation Options\n\nThe broad adaptation options of retreat, co-exist and defend are possible for all identified threats associated with climate change with efficacy varying with specific threats and circumstances [[33](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B33-climate-08-00007),[34](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B34-climate-08-00007)]. Within these, the literature identifies specific adaptive actions that reflect defensive or co-existing strategies that fall short of the ultimate strategy of retreat. The actions tend to be presented as discrete or punctuated choices without consideration of comparative efficacy, synergies, or priority.\n\n#### 3.2.1. Adaptation Options for Responding to Multiple Threats\n\nWhile some adaptation options are limited to address just one challenge, others are likely to have a systemic ameliorating effect and can be subdivided in five main approaches ([Table 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t001)).\n\n**Table 1.** Options for responding to multiple threats. \n\n![Image 7: Table](https://www.mdpi.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t001)\n\n*   Raise public awareness to encourage the local population to adapt and be prepared for the likely impacts of climate change and to foster community participation in decision-making. \n*   Planning (1) to avoid the worst consequences of the forecasted weather events, which involves production and frequent update of flooding and hazard maps; (2) legislation focused on (a) not permitting development on land vulnerable to hazards, or (b) establishing construction codes appropriate for the forecasted climatic conditions; and (3) plans to rapidly and efficiently respond to disasters, with disaster management and evacuation plans and warning systems to alert residents about imminent threats, such as fire and flooding. \n*   Political articulation and financial incentives to facilitate the integration between different government levels (regional, state and national) so that complex and expensive responses (e.g., rapid evacuation and/or construction of dykes) can be put in place in a timely manner. Financial incentives need to be also focused on both residents and industries so that economic constraints are not the main obstacle to allowing adaptation options to be implemented. \n*   Insurance to cover personal and government costs specifically associated with recovery after, for example, inundation, fire, weather events and/or failed crops. \n*   Labor and professional skills adjustment and enhancement so that new construction codes and new farming standards can be put in place. \n\n#### 3.2.2. Adaptation Options for Protecting Property and Infrastructure\n\nIn the context of risks associated with climate change, the main threats to properties and infrastructure on coastal areas are: flooding caused by sea level rise, storm surge, tide, freshwater flooding and wave run-up [[47](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B47-climate-08-00007)]; as well as fire, especially during droughts.\n\n(1) Flooding\n\nFlooding is already a problem in many places and it is likely to be aggravated with future sea level rise and with the intensification of storms. While inundation will mostly affect the coastline, it can also affect inland low-lying areas. If no adaptation options are put on place, property losses can be expected.\n\n\u2022 Coastlines and beaches\n\nFor the protection of the coastline, identified adaptation options included two main approaches ([Table 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t002)). The first is construction of physical barriers (e.g., seawalls, breakwaters, gabion, groins and sluices). This response type tends to squeeze the intertidal habitat, resulting in a reduction in habitat and a usurpation of the natural resilience of the habitat usually because of poor understanding of structural and ecological dynamics. Consequentially, but with an anthropocentric bias, this response should only be initiated \u201cwhere erosion presents an imminent threat to public safety or infrastructure that cannot practicably be removed or relocated. Where erosion protection structures are necessary, maintaining physical coastal processes outside the area subject to the coastal protection works is required to avoid adverse impacts on adjacent coastal landforms and associated ecosystems\u201d [[48](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B48-climate-08-00007)].\n\n**Table 2.** Options for responding to coastal fringe flooding. \n\n![Image 8: Table](https://www.mdpi.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t002)\n\nThe second is less construction oriented and involves improved environmental management, with approaches such as (a) protection of existing ecosystems and reforestation of areas adjacent to coastlines to reduce flooding from storm surge and dissipate the energy of waves, and hence, lessen the impact of wave run-ups; (b) beach nourishment focused on maintaining coastlines at a predetermined width (This can \u201cdisrupt species living, feeding, and nesting on the beach\u201d, as well as the habitats at dredging sites; also \u201cit is infeasible in areas where the wave energy is very high\u201d [[50](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B50-climate-08-00007),[55](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B55-climate-08-00007)]. Despite the likely negative impacts, beach nourishment is a common and frequent practice in many coastal areas.); (c) prohibition or control of the removal of beach sediments, because removal may accelerate beach erosion and disturb fauna; and (d) creation of artificial reefs to dissipate wave energy (and help to support marine biota).\n\n\u2022 Inland areas\n\nAdaptation options for avoiding inland inundation include elevating existing or constructing new canals and river walls, dykes, or sluices ([Table 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t003)). These options can be costly and if not planned for the highest predicted flood levels may prove ineffective. Environmental management approaches can also be applied to impede surface flows and enable water infiltration. These, however, are likely to be ineffective during extreme weather events.\n\n**Table 3.** Options for responding to inland flooding. \n\n![Image 9: Table](https://www.mdpi.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t003)\n\n\u2022 Infrastructure\n\nResponding to flooding risk particularly focused on protecting local infrastructure that supports what is generally considered to be essential services are a subset of inland flooding. Identified in the literature are actions such as (1) securing infrastructure (e.g., by elevating roads and airports, protecting energy transmission lines and diversifying energy reticulation and sources); (2) increasing waste and water treatment capacity; and (3) reducing water flows that may cause inundation and necessitating construction of dykes, seawalls and elevated canal walls to prevent sea water inundation ([Table 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t004)). However, this last approach will offer no protection to flooding caused by freshwater run-off, which may occur due to river level rise or storm water run-off during heavy rain. In these cases, dykes and sea and canal walls may be maladaptive and exacerbate problems by creating barriers that impede water flow.\n\n**Table 4.** Options for responding to the impacts of flooding on infrastructure. \n\n![Image 10: Table](https://www.mdpi.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t004)\n\n\u2022 Housing\n\nReducing the risks associated with flooding to residential homes is a political issue for local authorities, with many community members assuming that local government will take responsibility for reducing risk. Adaptation options identified in the literature vary from being of short-term benefit and low cost (e.g., landscaping) to requiring costly structural modification of homes to significantly reduce risk from all but more extreme events (e.g., substitution of material and building techniques and codes so that houses are cooler, more resistant to flood and extreme weather events) ([Table 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t005)) The option of constructing dwelling levees might be appropriate in specific circumstances at the extreme of a predicted flooding area, but would probably attract neighbor criticism or result, in the flooding event, in an unflooded island isolated from essential services.\n\n**Table 5.** Options for responding to the impacts of flooding on housing. \n\n![Image 11: Table](https://www.mdpi.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t005)\n\n(2) Fire\n\nWhile bushfires are common in many parts of the world and are part of natural processes, longer drought periods are likely to intensify fires and increase their frequency. Hazard reduction burning of fire-prone areas to create a mosaic of patches (in Australia, from 1 to 7-year intervals between burns) is advisable but will need careful monitoring and adaptive management to ensure the desired mix of vegetation types. There is the potential for community debate on the benefits and efficacy of hazard reduction burning, so community engagement on the rationale, planning and implementation of a program is essential. \n\nIn 2019, the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, Australia experienced delayed arrival of the usual spring and summer storms and with strong winds and arson activity resulted in an ember storm never previously experienced. While loss of human life and property damage was relatively low because of effective and targeted fire control by emergency services, wildlife suffered and the vulnerability of homes became evident under extreme fire weather conditions that hazard reduction burning could not mitigate likely impacts. Risk reduction might involve creation of wider fire breaks around homes in a community that enjoys its leafy suburbs. In any case, the Sunshine Coast community will need to mitigate the impacts of fire with shutters and sprinkler systems in high-risk zones and using building materials that are fire resistant ([Table 6](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t006)). This will necessitate changes in building codes.\n\n**Table 6.** Options for responding to the impacts of fire. \n\n![Image 12: Table](https://www.mdpi.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t006)\n\n#### 3.2.3. Adaptation Options for Protecting Natural Systems\n\nMajor changes are expected to occur within land and marine natural systems in the next century due to not only climate change, but also deforestation, over-use of resources and pollution. Broad adaptation options to minimize disruptions to local natural systems are largely changed management that includes: (1) better environmental management, including the creation of artificial reefs and environments, (2) improved adaptive management of fire and efficient irrigation of natural and or restored areas; and (3) provision of incentives for conservation in farming areas, including benefits from carbon sequestration opportunities ([Table 7](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t007)).\n\n**Table 7.** Options for responding to the impacts of climate change on natural systems. \n\n![Image 13: Table](https://www.mdpi.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t007)\n\n#### 3.2.4. Adaptation Options for Protecting Food Production\n\nDue to change in mean temperature and rainfall, severe drought and extinction of animal pollinators, food production is predicted to be at risk and may prove to be one of the most significant threats to humanity from climate change [[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B3-climate-08-00007)]. Adaptation options proposed in the literature tend to be relatively low cost management actions that do, however, require strategic research to inform changed management practice: (1) adapt cropping techniques and species; (2) improve water, environmental and soil management; and (3) provide financial and technical assistance to farmers to deal with weather-related changes ([Table 8](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t008)).\n\n**Table 8.** Options for responding to the impacts on farming and food production. \n\n![Image 14: Table](https://www.mdpi.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t008)\n\n#### 3.2.5. Adaptation Options for Protecting Availability of Fresh and Drinking Water\n\nWater is one of the most important resources for life. Yet, the availability of fresh and drinking water are likely to be reduced by climate change. Historically, many regions of the world suffer intermittently from lack of water, and this situation is likely to be aggravated by climate change, not only because of drought periods, which are likely to last longer and be more severe, but also due to salinization of fresh water systems in coastal areas caused by sea level rise. Adaptation options identified ([Table 9](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t009)) are largely at the property level and include:\n\n**Table 9.** Options for protecting the availability of fresh and drinking water. \n\n![Image 15: Table](https://www.mdpi.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t009)\n\n*   Installation of devices to prevent seawater from back flowing into storm drains; \n*   Create farm dams and in other locations; \n*   Require households and businesses to install rainwater tanks to supplement the reticulated water supply system; \n*   Develop and apply desalinization technologies; and \n*   Create irrigation systems to ensure hydration of vegetation. \n\n#### 3.2.6. Adaptation Options for Maintaining and or Improving Local Community Well-Being\n\nHotter weather and more intense storms are expected to affect community well-being. While emergency services will need to be prepared, households can act, at a cost, to reduce vulnerability. Adaptation options are largely housing improvements or modification ([Table 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t010)) but without guidelines and promoted smart practice, mandated building codes will probably be required that can be delayed by fear of political backlash to the household costs that would stem from retrospective regulation or increased cost of housing construction.\n\n**Table 10.** Options for maintaining and or improving local community well-being. \n\n![Image 16: Table](https://www.mdpi.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#table_body_display_climate-08-00007-t010)\n\n4. Discussion\n-------------\n\nIPCC reports demonstrate that climate change is strongly linked to human activity, and 195 countries are committed to mitigation action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapting its urban areas to respond to threats. All societies have a moral obligation to contribute, to the greatest extent possible, to reducing greenhouse gas emissions towards meeting international targets. For reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the primary driver for climate change mitigation lies within national and state energy policy and requires inter and intragovernmental cooperation for maximum efficacy. At the regional level, local authorities can show leadership by addressing their own emissions, informing businesses and households of mitigation actions they can voluntarily take, and by making bylaws that require mitigation action at the household and business levels. However, of immediate concern is the need to be prepared for climate change impacts by reducing risk and vulnerability of regional and household infrastructure: this requires encouraging and supporting adaptation.\n\n#### 4.1. Adaptation Spectrum\n\nThe options of defend, co-exist and retreat are not applied separately in urbanized areas. Instead, they progress as impacts become less manageable [[30](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B30-climate-08-00007),[33](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B33-climate-08-00007),[34](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B34-climate-08-00007)]. In the Torres Strait Islands (Australia), for example, seawalls were built as a defensive action to avoid flooding. As sea level rose, seawall efficacy diminished and flooding became more frequent [[24](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B24-climate-08-00007)]. Co-existence then took place until the situation became unmanageable and planning for retreat became an agenda item. In other words, while the academic literature presents the options of defend, co-exist and retreat as different adaptation approaches, they are stages within one spectrum of options. For this reason, in this work, the adaptation options presented were organized according to the component of interest in the affected system, with focus on properties and infrastructure, natural systems, food production, availability of water and well-being of the local population. The idea is that with the implementation of the identified options, retreat may be delayed or avoided.\n\n#### 4.2. Adaptation Options\n\nWhile people may acknowledge the reality of climate change, they are less aware of its implications at a local and household level (partly because of the imprecision of modelling), and even less aware of actions they can take to contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how to adapt to reduce their vulnerability to impacts. In this context, local governments can play a significant role in improving community knowledge of climate change, its impacts, mitigation actions and adaptations that can be made in preparation for climatic and resulting change and extreme events. What will be important to communicate is that climate change mitigation action can be also action to reduce impacts. Engagement with local communities should be a pillar for meeting the obligations inherent in demonstrating commitment to sustainable development.\n\nThe \u2018soft\u2019 options for adaptation, such as awareness raising, planning, political articulation and financial incentives, insurance and professional skills enhancement, can address mitigation and adaptation concomitantly and be implemented immediately at relatively low cost. The likelihood of such efforts being wasteful is low because they align with sustainability and represent insurance against the worst of climate change impacts.\n\nCommunity engagement is important because not all adaptation options can be implemented by governments who will be increasingly required to consider community-wide defensive actions in response to imminent threats to life and property. Residents and industries will need to modify their own properties and their management practices to ensure they are climate change ready, and not reliant on government to implement defensive measures as threats become imminent. Progressive implementation of adaptation strategies will have less upheaval of communities and individuals. Therefore, the responsibility of implementing adaption options in a timely manner at the regional level is shared between governments, residents and businesses. Yet, for adaptation to occur strategically and to optimize resource allocation, it should be orchestrated by local governments.\n\nAs climate change is likely to affect specific locations in multiple ways, including sea level rise, drought, extreme weather events and biodiversity extinction, it is unlikely that the implementation of just one adaptation option will address all climate change related problems. Hence, it is usually necessary to apply a systematic approach that addresses each threat and reduces the risk to affected areas and people. In this sense, further research would be necessary to develop a tool to assist in determining the most suitable and urgent adaptation options for each specific locale.\n\nWhile the World Economic Forum has ranked extreme weather events as one of the most significant threats to humanity [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B2-climate-08-00007)], it is important to keep in mind that risks are not only dependent on the hazard itself, but also on the strategies put on place to deal with challenges. The children\u2019s story The Three Little Pigs provides an analogy to better understand the risks that stem from weather events associated with climate change and the importance of adequate adaptation. In the story, while the same wolf menaces the three piglets, consequences significantly vary according to the structure protecting each of the piglets. With adequate warning, each piglet could better defend their existing infrastructure individually or collectively. The same is valid for the forecasted extreme weather events. While communities will be hit with the same perturbation strength, the consequences will vary depending on how each place, community and or person has prepared for the events. Those better adapted are likely to be less impacted.\n\n5. Conclusions\n--------------\n\nWhile the scientific community largely agrees with the reality of anthropogenically-induced climate changes and the urgency to address it and its impacts, there remains uncertainty about how much temperature will change especially in specific locations. This is partly due to the complex ecological functioning of our planetary ecosystem and our limited understanding of the feedback processes involved in climate regulation, which compromises the development and the results of existing models. Yet, this is but part of the problem. The main challenge is to forecast how humanity will address the issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how to respond to likely impacts in specific areas. Differences in forecasts of human response at national to local levels mean that the literature presents significant differences regarding predicted temperature rise and, consequently for example, by how much sea level is likely to rise, and appropriate response actions. IPCC works with conservative scenarios in which they consider temperature is likely to increase between 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C and sea level to rise between 0.26 m to 0.93 m by 2100, while the United Nations World Meteorological Organization estimates the temperature is more likely to increase between 3 \u00b0C to 5 \u00b0C by 2100 [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B1-climate-08-00007)]. Under the best or worst scenario, adaptation remains necessary and urgent.\n\nThe importance of adaptation to environmental conditions as a mean to survival is not new; it was first defended by Charles Darwin in Origin of Species in 1859 [[65](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/7#B65-climate-08-00007)]. Since then, it has been widely accepted that, not the strongest, nor the most intellectually capable, but the most flexible is more likely to survive. While Darwin\u2019s studies were not developed for the context of anthropogenic-induced climate change, his logic is equally valid for the forecasted warmer future. Therefore, paraphrasing Darwin, we can now say that those more likely to endure are those that are able to adapt and to adjust best to the changing environment in which they find themselves.\n\nThis work presented 80 adaptation options, mostly identified through systematic literature review. Not all options are adequate or necessary for all coastal communities; others would help mitigating impacts yet could be substituted by alternatives that would have a better cost-benefit in the specific region. The discussion here presented, focused on options that are generally suited for coastal areas. Suitability, in this case, relates to options that have positive cost benefits, with fewer negative impacts or with positive side effect consequences.\n\nAdaptation actions can be high to low cost and appropriate at household/business to community levels. Local governments will be required to lead defensive adaptations that reduce risk community-wide. They are also obliged to inform their constituencies of defensive adaptations that allow for co-existence. In both cases, assessment of cost-efficacy in reducing vulnerability is necessary and will depend on evaluation of local conditions and the level of risk associated with threats.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n--------------------\n\nIn developing this research article the authors by initials contributed the following: conceptualization, L.S. 40%, R.W.C. 60%; methodology, L.S. 40%, R.W.C. 60%; validation, L.S. 20%, R.W.C. 80%; investigation, L.S. 80%, R.W.C. 20%; data curation, L.S. 60%, R.W.C. 40%; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.S. 80%, R.W.C. 20%; writing\u2014review and editing, L.S. 30%, R.W.C. 70%; visualization, L.S. 50%, R.W.C. 50%; project administration, L.S. 20%, R.W.C. 80%; and funding acquisition, R.W.C. 100%.

Already, producers and land managers across the country are experiencing these impacts in the form of shifting weather patterns and increasingly intense extreme events like floods and wildfire.\n\n![Image 10: An image referencing the climate adaptation cycle of awareness, assessment, planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/oce-climate-adaptation-cycle.png)\n\nTo address the impacts of climate change on USDA\u2019s mission delivery and to meet stakeholder needs in a changing climate, [the Office of Energy and Environmental Policy](https://www.usda.gov/oce/energy-and-environment) (OEEP) works across USDA to ensure that the effects of climate change on working lands and rural communities are understood, and that climate adaptation is integrated into USDA programs, policies, and operations and based on the most up-to-date [science](https://www.usda.gov/oce/energy-and-environment/climate/assessments).\n\n**CLIMATE ADAPTATION** is the process of adjusting to avoid the expected or actual consequences of climate change. Climate adaptation at USDA is an iterative process of assessment, planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation (see figure).\n\nAdaptation actions aim to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human systems to climate change and can include actions to reduce exposure and sensitivity to climate effects and increase adaptive capacity. Examples in agriculture and forestry can include:\n\n*   Changes in farming and land management practices to build long-term resilience,\n*   Strengthening disaster preparedness and recovery,\n*   Increased access to useful and usable tools and technology, and\n*   Outreach and education to build adaptive capacity.\n\n### CLIMATE ADAPTATION AT USDA\n\n[![Image 11: Cover page for the 2024 USDA Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, forest on fire.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/USDA-ClimatePlanCover2024.jpg)](https://www.sustainability.gov/pdfs/usda-2024-cap.pdf \"(opens in a new window)\") USDA\u2019s [2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan](https://www.sustainability.gov/pdfs/usda-2024-cap.pdf \"(opens in a new window)\") draws on every Mission Area to assess current and future climate-related risks to USDA\u2019s operations and mission-delivery. The Plan describes actions the Department is taking to manage risks to its facilities, employees, and lands and integrate consideration of climate adaptation and resilience into its planning, budget formulation, decision-making, policies, programs, and funding opportunities. These proactive efforts will prepare USDA to better serve and support its stakeholders as they tackle the effects of climate change on their farms, forests, and in their communities.\n\nThe 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan builds off USDA\u2019s [Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience](https://www.sustainability.gov/pdfs/usda-2021-cap.pdf \"(opens in a new window)\"), released in [October 2021](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/10/07/usda-announces-plan-integrate-climate-adaptation-its-missions-and).

These plans identify climate risks and prioritize actions the agencies will implement to integrate climate adaptation into their planning, programs, operations, and management. Adaptation is an iterative process that will evolve based on lessons learned and emerging climate risks.\n\n[Farm Production and Conservation](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/general-information/staff-offices/office-chief-economist/office-energy-and-environmental-policy/climate-change/climate-change-adaptation#)\nAmerica\u2019s farmers and ranchers are on the frontlines of climate change. USDA\u2019s Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) Mission Area \u2013 consisting of the [Farm Service Agency](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/) (FSA), the [Natural Resources Conservation Service](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/) (NRCS), the [Risk Management Agency](https://www.rma.usda.gov/) (RMA), and the FPAC Business Center \u2013 delivers a breadth of programs and services to America\u2019s farmers, ranchers, and private forest landowners. Together, these agencies administer a wide variety of farm loan, disaster assistance, safety net, risk management, and conservation programs, helping producers weather economic ups and downs as well as grow and improve their operations. As the impacts of climate change hit agricultural communities, FPAC is committed to supporting producers through equitable delivery of voluntary, incentive-based tools to build resilience and innovate in the implementation of climate solutions. As it implements these climate adaptation plans, FPAC will continue to engage agriculture and forestry stakeholders to inform and further refine these strategies.\n\n[![Image 13: Cover page for the 2022 NRCS Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, mosaic image of cow, river, butterfly, soil, greenhouse, sprinkler, tractor.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/1_FPAC_NRCS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.jpg)](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1_FPAC_NRCS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.pdf)[![Image 14: Cover page for the 2022 FSA Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, mosaic of various fields.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2_FPAC_FSA_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.jpg)](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2_FPAC_FSA_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.pdf)[![Image 15: Cover page for the 2022 RMA Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, mosaic of Secretary Vilsack, field, thermometer reading 90 degrees.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/3_FPAC_RMA_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.jpg)](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/3_FPAC_RMA_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.pdf)\n\n[Natural Resources and Environment](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/general-information/staff-offices/office-chief-economist/office-energy-and-environmental-policy/climate-change/climate-change-adaptation#)\n\n[![Image 16: Cover page for the 2022 FS Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, aerial view of cloud shrouded mountains.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/4_NRE_FS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.jpg)](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/4_NRE_FS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.pdf)\n\nWith its oversight of the National Forest System and work with other Federal agencies, States, private landowners, and Tribes, the climate adaptation efforts of the [Forest Service](https://www.fs.usda.gov/) (FS) are far-reaching. Climate adaptation and mitigation efforts on the part of the Forest Service are closely linked due to the role of forests as critical carbon sinks and the increased risk of wildfire and other climate stressors. The Forest Service\u2019s Climate Adaptation Plan describes how it will implement science-based, climate-adapted land management solutions to meet the needs of present and future generations.\n\n[![Image 17: Cover page for the Fiscal Year 2023 Forest Service Climate Action Tracker Report.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/4.1_NRE_FS_ClimateActionTracker_2023.png)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/climate-action-tracker-2023.pdf)\n\n**Implementation Progress:**\n\nIn 2024, Forest Service released their second progress report on agency climate change actions. Progress in the tracker is measured across four dimensions: Serving People, Organizational Capacity, Natural Resources Stewardship, and Operations and Infrastructure. The Fiscal Year 2023 Climate Action Tracker also includes a summary of Regional Climate Action Plans that were developed by each Forest Service region.\n\n[Research, Education, and Economics](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/general-information/staff-offices/office-chief-economist/office-energy-and-environmental-policy/climate-change/climate-change-adaptation#)\nAdvances in research and science are foundational to enabling society to better address climate change in agricultural systems. By improving our understanding of the relationship between climate change and agricultural production, USDA can advance more innovative and equitable solutions for American producers and land managers. USDA\u2019s Research, Education, and Economics (REE) Mission Area leads a breadth of climate change research and science through its five scientific agencies and office, including the [Agricultural Research Service](https://www.ars.usda.gov/) (ARS), the [National Institute of Food and Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/6_REE_NIFA_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.pdf) (PDF, 752 KB)Is this the co (NIFA), the [Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/) (ERS), and the [National Agricultural Statistics Service](https://www.nass.usda.gov/) (NASS), and the [Office of the Chief Scientist](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/general-information/staff-offices/office-chief-scientist) (OCS). REE\u2019s collective work informs a diverse array of stakeholders from American producers and land managers to Federal and international government policies and programs. Together, the REE mission area invests significantly in advancing research, extension, and education programs to improve our understanding of greenhouse gas fluxes through agricultural systems, co-develop tools and practices that will help American producers adapt to the effects of climate change on their land, and support the current and future agricultural science workforce. REE is committed to advancing scientific leadership on climate change science that is reliable, timely, relevant, and free from political interference to produce robust data that benefits stakeholders and advances scientific knowledge. REE will continue to strive to include a diverse set of stakeholders in developing climate science projects to better address research and science needs of the diverse communities USDA serves.\n\n[![Image 18: Cover page for the 2022 ARS Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, sprout in field.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/5_REE_ARS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.jpg)](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/5_REE_ARS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.pdf)[![Image 19: Cover page for the 2022 NIFA Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, aerial view of fields by a shore.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/6_REE_NIFA_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.jpg)](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/6_REE_NIFA_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.pdf)[![Image 20: Cover page for the 2022 ERS Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, satellite view of a hurricane.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/7_REE_ERS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.jpg)](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/7_REE_ERS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.pdf)[![Image 21: Cover page for the 2022 NASS Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, USDA and NASS census logos.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/8_REE_NASS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.jpg)](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/8_REE_NASS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.pdf)[![Image 22: Cover page for the 2024 OCS Climate Adaptation Plan.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/16_REE_OCS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2024.png)](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/16_REE_OCS_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2024.pdf)\n\n**Implementation Progress:**\n\nIn 2024, NIFA released an accomplishments report highlighting the agency\u2019s progress over the last two years on the 44 unique actions outlined in the NIFA Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan.

Something went wrong while submitting the form.\n\n# **How does urban planning contribute to climate change?**\n\nCities, as major contributors to global emissions, have the power to reshape their landscapes for better environmental outcomes. Urban planning decisions influence how cities grow, impacting emissions and resilience to climate impacts.\n\nMitigation and adaptation are the dual focus. Mitigation aims to reduce emissions through design and policy, while adaptation enhances resilience against climate impacts:\n\n* **Mitigation**: Urban planners design walkable communities and promote public transportation to reduce vehicle emissions. They integrate green spaces to act as carbon sinks, lowering overall emissions.\n* **Adaptation**: Cities are fortified against climate impacts. Infrastructure is built to withstand rising sea levels. Urban greenery is increased to manage extreme heat.\n\nCities are at the forefront of climate action. They utilize land use, zoning, and transportation control to foster sustainable development. By implementing environmental master plans, cities can reduce emissions and enhance resilience, making urban planning a critical tool in the global climate strategy.\n\n## **Urban design strategies for reducing emissions**\n\nTransportation-related emissions are a significant contributor to urban air pollution. Planning decisions that prioritize reducing these emissions can lead to substantial environmental benefits. Urban design strategies for reducing emissions\u00a0 include:\n\n* **Walkable Neighborhoods**: Designing neighborhoods that prioritize pedestrian access reduces reliance on motor vehicles. This approach lowers transportation emissions by encouraging walking and cycling.\n* **Public Transit Integration**: Effective integration of multimodal transit systems reduces individual car use. By enhancing connectivity through buses, trains, and other public transportation options, urban areas can decrease emissions and improve energy efficiency. For instance, cities like London have implemented measures such as the [Ultra-Low Emission Zone](https://www.clarity.io/blog/air-pollution-traffic-monitoring-strategies-for-reducing-emissions-in-big-cities) to significantly curb traffic-related pollution.\n* **Green Building Standards**: Incorporating green infrastructure in urban development supports energy conservation. Implementing standards for energy-efficient buildings, utilizing renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable construction methods contribute to lower carbon emissions.\n\n## **Technology's role in sustainable urban development**\n\nTechnology transforms urban planning by providing tools that support sustainable development. Smart city technologies, real-time data monitoring, and decision-support tools offer urban planners the ability to make informed, data-driven decisions. These technologies align urban development with climate goals.\n\nSmart city technologies utilize interconnected systems to optimize urban functions. [Exploring the trends in the Smart City industry](https://www.clarity.io/blog/looking-ahead-to-2018-smart-city-industry-trends), such as citizen empowerment and sustainability, can help urban planners understand how to improve resource efficiency and sustainability in urban areas. Real-time data monitoring allows planners to track environmental conditions, enabling quick responses to pollution and other urban challenges. Smart city technologies include:\n\n* **Real-Time Data Monitoring**: Offers immediate insights into air quality and environmental conditions, allowing for rapid adjustments in urban planning strategies.\n* **Modeling Technologies**: Aid planners in assessing greenhouse gas impacts of various urban designs, guiding sustainable development strategies.\n* **Decision-Support Tools**: Facilitate informed decision-making by providing comprehensive analyses of urban forms and transportation options.\n* **Smart Infrastructure**: Enhances building energy efficiency and supports the integration of electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nBy utilizing transparent data collection and sharing, planners can implement sustainable urban policies effectively. [Leveraging innovative approaches to improve air quality in urban settings](https://www.clarity.io/blog/clean-air-cities-innovative-approaches-to-improving-air-quality-in-urban-settings) ensures that urban areas can adapt to climate challenges while promoting sustainability.\n\n## **Building resilience in urban areas**\n\nEffective resilience planning involves integrating strategies into urban design that address vulnerabilities associated with extreme weather, rising sea levels, and increasing temperatures. By anticipating these challenges, cities can protect communities and infrastructure.\n\nUrban planners focus on several key adaptation strategies:\n\n* **Green Spaces**: Incorporate parks and urban greenery to reduce urban heat, improve air quality, and manage stormwater. Green spaces act as natural buffers against climate extremes, providing shade and cooling effects.\n* **Fortified Infrastructure**: Develop robust buildings and transport systems to withstand climate stressors. This includes elevating structures in flood-prone areas and reinforcing bridges and roads to handle extreme weather.\n* **Climate-Specific Urban Planning**: Implement zoning laws and building codes that consider local climate risks. Tailor urban designs to address specific regional threats such as hurricanes or droughts, ensuring long-term sustainability. Additionally, understanding the [impact of air quality management in urban planning](https://www.clarity.io/blog/air-quality-management-2-0-what-is-the-future-of-air-quality-management-for-large-cities-what-role-do-air-quality-sensors-play) can further enhance city resilience.\n\n## **Urban planning as a climate change solution**\n\nUrban planning drives climate change solutions through city design. When cities plan well, they cut emissions and handle climate challenges more effectively. Smart design transforms urban areas into sustainable, resilient spaces that work for everyone.\n\nUrban planners use proven methods to create climate-friendly cities. They design neighborhoods that promote walking and cycling, reducing reliance on cars and cutting emissions. Green spaces like parks, tree-lined streets, and urban forests not only lower carbon output but also cool cities and improve mental well-being. Modern cities increasingly rely on smart technology and real-time data to optimize traffic flow, energy use, and waste management. These systems help cities run more efficiently and adapt quickly to environmental challenges, making everyday life more sustainable for residents.\n\nInvesting in strong infrastructure\u2014like flood defenses, heat-resistant materials, and efficient public transport\u2014helps protect cities against climate-related threats. These adaptations strengthen urban resilience during extreme weather events, keeping communities safe and functioning.\n\nLocal-level planning leads to real, measurable climate action. When cities take the lead, they become key drivers of global climate progress. Urban planning isn\u2019t just about buildings and roads\u2014it\u2019s about shaping healthier, more livable futures. By integrating air quality goals into development strategies, cities can reduce pollution at the source, improve public health, and support long-term sustainability. From zoning policies that limit emissions to investments in clean energy and mobility, planners are at the frontline of building climate-ready, breathable cities.\n\nTo find an air quality solution that works with your urban planning goals, visit our [Build your Solution](https://www.clarity.io/build-your-solution) page.
