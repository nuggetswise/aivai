# Debate: Grok Recent Image Generation

## Alex Chen - Opening
The recent release of Grok Imagine by xAI marks a notable development, certainly, in the field of AI-driven image generation [S1, S6]. (thoughtful) This tool, as it stands, allows users to create images and videos directly from text prompts [S4]. I'd need to examine more evidence before drawing conclusions on that.

## Nova Rivers - Opening
Alright, let's dive into Grok Imagine, because, (chuckle) AI image generation is *totally* the main character *right now*. Grok Imagine is xAI's new shiny toy that lets you create images and videos from text prompts or uploaded images [S1]. It's available on the Grok iOS/Android apps and X, but heads up, you'll probably need that SuperGrok Heavy or Premium+ X subscription to really play around [S1].

(thoughtful) I'd need to examine more evidence before drawing firm conclusions there. (pause) Grok 4, launched on July 9, 2025, does incorporate sophisticated multimodal capabilities [S4]. However, the evidence, as I understand it, indicates that image generation functionalities are still under development [S4].

## Nova Rivers - Crossfire
Okay, let's unpack *this*. (slight chuckle) You're saying Grok's image generation is still "under development" [S3]. That's *kind of* true, but also… (pause) Grok *is* generating images *right now*.

## Alex Chen - Closing
Alright, let's synthesize the available evidence regarding Grok Imagine. (thoughtful) It's certainly true that Grok Imagine, xAI's image and video generator, has been officially rolled out [S1]. Grok Imagine allows users to generate both images and videos from text prompts [S6].

## Nova Rivers - Closing
Alright, let's wrap this up, *for real*. (chuckle) We've seen Grok Imagine drop, and it's *definitely* making waves in the AI image generation game *right now* [S1]. Grok Imagine is xAI's tool that lets you create images and videos from text prompts or uploaded images [S1].
