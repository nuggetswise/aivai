We need specifics on image resolution, generation speed, and comparisons against other leading image generation models (e.g., DALL-E 3, Midjourney) from peer-reviewed studies or reputable tech publications. This would provide a more objective assessment of Grok's capabilities beyond marketing claims.",

Specifically, we need information from xAI or independent audits about measures taken to prevent the generation of harmful content such as deepfakes, biased imagery, or content that violates copyright or intellectual property laws. Reports from AI safety organizations or academic research on these aspects would be valuable."
