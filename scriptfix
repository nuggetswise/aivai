You are editing a debate script in Markdown for a podcast episode. Do the following transformations, preserving meaning and inline citation tags like [S1], [S2], etc.

1) Add a succinct host intro and outro as H2 sections:
   ## Host - Intro - Alex
   ## Host - Outro - Nova
   The intro should set the topic in 2–3 sentences. The outro should give 2–3 sentence takeaways.

2) Normalize speakers and section headers to this pattern:
   ## Alex Chen - Opening
   ## Nova Rivers - Opening
   ## Alex Chen - Crossfire
   ## Nova Rivers - Crossfire
   ## Alex Chen - Closing
   ## Nova Rivers - Closing

3) Remove pipeline artifacts and meta text, including lines mentioning:
   - "Pipeline failed", "refined commentary", "preservation rules", internal system notes.

4) Tighten each paragraph to 2–3 sentences. Keep only brief stage cues in parentheses like (pause), (chuckle), (thoughtful). Remove repetitive filler lines (e.g., repeated “The current evidence doesn’t support a definitive position on this.”)

5) Preserve all bracketed citations [S1]...[S6] in-place. At the end, add:
   ## Sources
   and leave a stubbed list:
   - [S1] Title — URL
   - [S2] Title — URL
   ... (do not fabricate; just keep placeholders if not provided)

6) Ensure the final Markdown is clean, readable, and ready for TTS.

Return only the complete, cleaned Markdown.
